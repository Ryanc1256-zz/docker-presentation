                        Scale is a strong selling point for this platform.

                        Most if not all Cloud platform have a idea of 'cluster',
                        A cluster is best visualised as 'group of virtual machines'
                        with a cluster you can it from 1 to 1M pods

                  <section>
                      So linking 'pods' together is great! it's very handy in the way
                      of databases that are in there own scalable cluster.

                      <p class="fragment">
                        So you can create a link between two or more pods, and make an external service accessible within
                        a pod, so a good example is mongodb.

                        I will just list the two popular

                        Kubernetes  is a tool made by Google then open sourced, for use
                        in the public and a lot of high tier companies have started to use it,
                        like

                        <p class="fragment">
                            ebay
                        </p>

                        It makes tasks vastly easier for example scale...

                        <p class="fragment">
                            <code class="bash">kubeclt scale --replicas=5 rc myproject </code>
                        </p>

                    <section>
                        Also a lot of other maintance tasks are vaslty easier

                        <p class="fragment">
                            removing a image, pods and release candidates
                        </p>

                        <p class="fragment">
                            making new releases
                        </p>

                        <p class="fragment">
                            deployments, this part is vaslty cooler... you can do a thing
                            called 'rolling updates' which means that they will slowly update each pod,
                            making sure that nothing is going to crash and break
